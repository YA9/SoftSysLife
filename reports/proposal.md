## Project Goal

The goal for this project is to write my own implementation for John Conway's Game of Life, also known as the zero-player game. This is a simulation game that operates on a grid of binary squares and a certain set of rules. According to Wikipedia, "Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation." With these rules, the game can create some amazing emergent structures and seemingly living organisms. My lower bound for this project is a set starting configuration in C that abides by these rules. If I achieve this, a more ambitious bound would be to include a user mouse interface where they can click to change if a cell is dead or alive. I can also add a splash screen and adjustments for speed.

## Learning Goals

My main learning goal for this project is to understand how to work with 2D arrays to represent game data. With my previous project (Slytherin), I represented the snake as a doubly-linked-list and there was no need to create or scan a game board. I currently don't have an idea of how to check for neighbors of cells. Another learning goal is to learn how to work with user interfaces such that a user can click options with their mouse.

## Resources

This is a very common game to implement, so there should be a variety of resources available to use online. I have watched a few tutorials on this and do have a tutorial in mind to reference in case I get stuck. That being said, there's a good chance I would need help and I can probably get that through messaging Manu or going to CA hours.

## First Steps

I will start by watching a tutorial and reading some articles online about a practical approach to this game. I will then write an outline of how to approach the implementation. Finally, I'll just start writing the code and take it step by step. For the implementation, I will start by first trying to reach my MVP, then slowly adding features as I see fit since that approach worked well for my last project.
